In this project i have wrtten a research paper on 'Comparitive Study on Time Series Forecasting Using Deep Learning Models'.
The link for the paper is: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/339771117_Comparative_Study_on_Time_Series_Forecasting_using_Deep_learning_Models .
In univariate and multivariate time series forecasting, there are many proposed traditional models
The problem with traditional models is that they are unable to predict high number of observations.
Deep learning models avoid these problems. In this paper, a comparative study is done on two time series datasets "Occupancy Dataset" and "Google Stock Price Dataset".
Both these datasets are used for multivariate and univariate time series forecasting. Prediction was done for 'temperature' from Occupancy dataset and 'open' from Google Stock Price dataset. Various state of the art sequence transduction, deep learning models are used.
The models used are Long-Short Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), Convolution Neural Network (CNN) and Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP).
In additon, ARIMA model is used for univariate analysis.
